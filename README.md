# Client/Server Architecture Using MySQL


## Intro

 In this project I'm going to build a client-server architecture which is a concept where two computers are connected together over a network to send and recieve request between one another. The two machines being client (sending the request) and server (responding to the requests). This will be done using SQL

 MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.

## EC2 Configuration

- Firstly two ubuntu 22.04 ec2's are lauched, one the client the other the server. 

 ![ec2](/ec2.png)

 Firstly both ec2 were updated and mysql was installed via the following command below. We start of with our client server. 

 ```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

systemctl is-active mysql  # verify

 ```

 - Byt default both of our ec2 are in the same local virtual network, MySQL server uses TCP port 3306 which is configured in mysql-server ibound security group.
 - Mysql-server is configured to allow connections from mysql-client, via `sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`, the bind address is changed to 0.0.0.0 to allow all. Afterwhich the client server is restarted through `sudo systemctl restart mysql`

## User Creation 

- In the mysql-server instance we log in to mysql anc create users and grant those users remote access to our instance.

```
sudo mysql
GRANT ALL ON database_name.* TO user_name@'ip_address' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';

```

 ## Remote Connection

 - Finally in our mysql-server instance we allow access to the IP of the mysql-client.

 ```
 sudo ufw allow from <mysql-client port> to any port 3306

# or allow all IP's
sudo ufw allow 3306

 ```

  ![port](/allow_port.png)

  - We can now connect to our mysql-server through our mysql-client via

  ```
  mysql -u user_name -h mysql_server_ip -p

  ```
